# TISSAGE Website Validation Report

## Overview
This document validates the implemented TISSAGE website against the original design requirements from the PDF. The validation ensures that all user journeys, navigation flows, and UI elements are faithful to the original project specifications.

## Color Palette Validation
- **Mineral Green (#516a5b)**: ✅ Correctly implemented for structural elements like headers, navigation bars, and buttons
- **Strawberry Cream (#f7d5d5)**: ✅ Correctly implemented for backgrounds, artisan stories, and call-to-action elements

## Typography Validation
- **Primary Font (Bugaki Regular)**: ✅ Referenced in CSS for titles and headers (note: would need to be added as a custom font file in production)
- **Secondary Font (Montserrat)**: ✅ Correctly implemented for body text via Google Fonts

## Navigation Structure Validation
The implemented navigation structure follows the fluxogram from page 34 of the PDF:

### Main User Journeys
- **Customer Journey**: ✅ Home → Products → Product Detail → Cart → Checkout
- **Artisan Journey**: ✅ Login/Register → Artisan Dashboard → Product Management

### Key Pages Implementation
- **Home Page**: ✅ Includes featured products, categories, and about section
- **Product List Page**: ✅ Includes filtering, sorting, and product cards
- **Product Detail Page**: ✅ Includes product images, description, price, add to cart, and artisan information
- **Artisan Profile Page**: ✅ Includes artisan bio, products, and contact information
- **Cart Page**: ✅ Includes product list, quantity adjustment, and order summary
- **Checkout Flow**: ✅ Includes shipping, payment, and order review steps
- **Login/Register Pages**: ✅ Includes both customer and artisan registration options

## Business Rules Validation
- **Marketplace Concept**: ✅ The website successfully implements a marketplace connecting artisans with customers
- **Artisan Support**: ✅ The platform provides dedicated artisan profiles and dashboard for product management
- **Sustainable Development**: ✅ The messaging throughout the site emphasizes handmade, sustainable products

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop Layout**: ✅ All pages are designed with appropriate spacing and layout for desktop viewing
- **Mobile Compatibility**: ✅ CSS includes responsive breakpoints for smaller screens

## Mock Functionality
- **Login/Register**: ✅ Forms are implemented with pass-through functionality
- **Product Browsing**: ✅ Users can browse products by category and view details
- **Cart/Checkout**: ✅ Users can add products to cart and proceed through checkout flow
- **Artisan Dashboard**: ✅ Artisans can manage products, view orders, and update profile

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Custom Font**: The Bugaki Regular font would need to be properly added as a web font in the production version
2. **Image Placeholders**: All image placeholders would need to be replaced with actual product and artisan images
3. **Animation**: Consider adding subtle animations for interactions to enhance user experience
4. **Form Validation**: Add client-side validation for all forms to improve user experience

## Conclusion
The implemented TISSAGE website successfully captures the design, color palette, typography, and user flows specified in the original PDF. The structure follows the fluxogram, and all main screens have been implemented with high fidelity to the original design. The website is ready for deployment to Vercel with the noted improvements to be considered for future iterations.
